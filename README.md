Hi, I'm Robert :)

I am a PhD student at Chalmers University of Technology, in the functional programming unit of the computing science division.
My supervisor is Koen Claessen, and my co-supervisors are John Hughes and Bo Joel Svensson.

I am interested in compilers, programming languages and testing. I try to orient my research around the Internet of Things and Security, using Haskell as my weapon of choice.

My publications can be found on my google scholar page :)

You can reach me at krookr@chalmers.se, or just drop by my office in the EDIT building, 6215.
