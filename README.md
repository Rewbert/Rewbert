I'm Robert :)

I am a PhD student at Chalmers University of Technology, in the functional programming unit of the computing science division.
My supervisor is Koen Claessen, and my co-supervisors are John Hughes and Bo Joel Svensson.

While my main interests are compilers, programming languages and property-based testing, I am really a fan of all things Haskell. Recently I have slipped into the rabbit-hole of TEE (Trusted Execution Environment(s)), where I might stay a while. I try to orient my research around the Internet of Things and Security, using Haskell as my weapon of choice.

My publications can be found on my google scholar page :)

You can reach me at my work email, krookr@chalmers.se, or my private email, robert@krook.dev. You can also just drop by my office in the EDIT building, room 6215.
